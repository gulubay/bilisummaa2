						<h1>About Us</h1>
						<br>
						<p>

							Bilisummaa is a clothing company established in Toronto but made its debut at Osfna 2017 in Minnesota. The brand originally started out as way to tackle the youth's decreasing interests in African roots. And Bilisummaa solves this by creating modern Oromo cultural trends. Using inspirational traditional clothing. Bilisummaa incorporates styles into everyday Oromowear. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							The word Bilisummaa was chosen because it means Freedom. And we intend to express that with our clothes. Expressing all that is Oromummaa and Africa!  We hope our fashion can help each other express tokkummaa(together as one).
							
							Bilisummaa
